# Creative Presentation Guide for MI-AIR-2025 ðŸš€

This project is designed for a creative, interactive presentation experienceâ€”no PowerPoint required! Hereâ€™s how to use the features:

---

## 1. GitHub Pages (Optional)
- Enable GitHub Pages in your repo settings for a website view of your Markdown files.
- Use the default or a Jekyll theme for better navigation.
- [Learn more about GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

---

## 2. Markdown-Based Slide Decks (Marp)
- Write slides in Markdown using Marp syntax (see `SLIDES.md` for an example).
- Render slides locally with [Marp for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode) or export as PDF/HTML.
- Marp slides can be committed to the repo for sharing.

---

## 3. Interactive Markdown Navigation
- Use the main `README.md` and `abstracts/abstracts.md` for navigation.
- Collapsible sections (`<details>`) and emojis make it fun and easy to browse.

---

## 4. Live Demos & Code Snippets
- Embed code blocks and command-line examples in all outlines.
- Add animated GIFs (see `.github/assets/demo.gif`) to show workflows.

---

## 5. GitHub Discussions & Wiki

- (Optional) Enable the Wiki for collaborative notes.
