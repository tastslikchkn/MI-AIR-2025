# Part 3 Outline: Vibe Coding with Local LLMs

## Abstract

**Affiliation:**  

**Abstract:**  
The final presentation introduces Vibe Coding, a paradigm where local LLMs directly enhance coding productivity through real-time suggestions. We’ll explore how analysts with a basic understanding of coding and logic can leverage their locally hosted models to auto-complete code, debug errors, and generate documentation in IDEs such as VSCode. The session will cover configuring VSCode for specific coding tasks (e.g., Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript), customizing model behavior with prompts, and enhancing capabilities via leading edge extensions. We will develop software using hierarchical prompting techniques. Attendees will be equipped to implement LLM-powered workflows tailored to their development needs while maintaining full control over data privacy and computational resources. If you plan to attend it is suggested that you register for Part 1 and 2.
