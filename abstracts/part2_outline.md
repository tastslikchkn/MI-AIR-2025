# Part 2 Outline: Bridging Local LLMs to Apps 🔗

## Abstract
**Authors:**  
**Affiliation:**  

**Abstract:**  
Building on the Part 1 session’s foundational knowledge, this presentation dives into integrating local large language models (LLM) into open-source applications. We’ll explore leveraging RESTful API endpoints to connect LLMs with tools like chatbots, data analysis platforms, custom scripts, and Integrated Development Environments (IDE). Topics include performance optimization for low resource environments, training analytics platforms. Hands-on demos will showcase how to integrate LLMs into workflows using Python’s requests library and toolkits like LangChain. The session concludes with a live demonstration of IDE integration that enables real-time agentic coding powered by local models. This demo sets the stage for Part 3, where we’ll explore Vibe Coding in depth. If you plan to attend it is suggested that you register for Part 1 and 3.
